	<h1>CHOLERA OUTBREAK in LONDON - 1854</h1>

	<div>
		<p>To complete this project, we will recreate Dr. John Snow's map using modern tools (D3). Additionally, we will
			recreate the original map in an interactive version and add interface elements to make it more interactive.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>INTENT:</h3>
		<p>To recreate John Snowâ€™s outbreak map using D3 JavaScript.</p>
	</div>







	<div>
		<h3>REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROJECT:</h3>
		<p>I have gone through the deliverables of my project and summarized the requirements.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Map showing the location of the deaths (streets, pumps)</li>
			<li>An interactive timeline graph showing the number of deaths per day</li>
			<li>The mouse is used to select the respective day to visualize the respective number of deaths displayed
			</li>
			<li>Interactive visualization of the map with the ability to zoom in and zoom out </li>
			<li>A labeled and stable timeline graph is shown to the users </li>
			<li>Visualization check with color blindness tool </li>
			<li>Easily identifying the gender of each victim on the map</li>
			<li>Age-based death graph with clearly labeled counts </li>
			<li>An additional graph illustrating death distribution by sex and age </li>
			<li>In the timeline graph, data can be shown from a certain window of time </li>

		</ol>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>DESIGN STEPS:</h3>

		<p> Based on the given data, I have used all data in the chart using d3 js lib. Using street data created a map
			chart based on the x, y co-ordinates
			and I have used various color to differentiate the attributes. Black refers to MALE, blue refers to FEMALE,
			red color is refer to PUMPS location, green is for WORKHOUSE location and yellow is for BREWERY location.
			By moving the cursor to the black or blue dots on the map you can see the age group of the victim
			The street name is also mentioned in the map. Here timeline chart also created to understand the death based
			on the days and also whenerver
			mouseover on the timeline chart based on the date death locations are updated in map .
			<br>
			I have developed a timeline chart with the given dataset. From the timeline chart, we can see the epidemic
			has reached its peak on Sep-1st and afterwards it started reducing gradually.

		<br>
		<p>
			Developed two additional charts
			<br>
			1. Age-based death chart <br>
			2. Gender-based death chart. <br>
			Age based death chart shows the age groups and number of deaths between the age groups. </p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>OBSERVATIONS/RESULTS:</h3>
		<p>Percentage of people in each age group in general during that time
			were 0-10: 28%, 11-20: 25%, 21-40: 30%, 41-60: 13%, 61-80: 4%, > 80: 1%. Here we assume the same for London.
			The largest number of victims were the older people aged greater than 80. The second largest were the kids
			in age range 0-10. </p>
